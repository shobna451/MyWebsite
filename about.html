                    <p>Krystle Aulak started her career at the tender age of 16 having a dream to open cake shop called "Cakes Specialist". She was encouraged to pursue her talents in cake decorating by both her family & colleagues and worked her way up to manageress of the shop by the age of 20. The opportunity to buy the cake shop came her way in 1992 and her dream became a reality.</p>
					<br>
					<p>Although not small any more, the business tries to keep the family atmosphere where we care not only about our company, our products and our staff, but also we consider each "customer" a member in this family of "cakes Specialist".</p>
					<br>
					<p>Our mission is to make people happy. Making delicious cakes, having relaxing chairs in a smoking free environment and keeping our prices reasonable are all different ways to achieve this goal.</p>
					<br>
					<p>The Cakes  Specialist offers only the best quality ingredients to customers, teamed with immaculate attention to detail to create the perfect centrepiece, whatever the occasion. Staff provide an extremely professional service, from the initial consultation and cake tastings, to the collection or delivery and set-up of the cake, offering expert advice on choosing the perfect design for your special occasion and how to store your cake should there be any left over.</p>
